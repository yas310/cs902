You are going to write a program to simulate a banking application for just one customer.

When a user runs your program, it should display the menu with the following options and ask the user for input.   
 

Type `D`  to deposit money. Type `W` to withdraw money.

Type `B` to display Balance

Type `E` to exit.

* If the user types `D`
    * Ask the user to enter the amount to deposit. When the user enters the amount, update the balance. 
    * And display the menu again
* If the user types `W` then
    * Ask the user to enter the amount he/she wants to withdraw.  When the user enters the amount, subtract the amount from the balance.
* If the user enters `B`, then
    * Display the balance to the user
* If the user types `E` then
    * Terminate the program.
* If the user types any other option:
    * Display the message “Invalid Choice. Try again” and go back and display the menu.
 

**PS: You program must keep displaying the menu until the user types the option `E`, to exit the program.  For this, you can use, `Do`.. `Loop` `Until`.**


P.S: Your final exam will also going to be a project.
