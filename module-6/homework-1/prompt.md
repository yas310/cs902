Banking Application using Arrays and Functions.
After you write and submit this program, please keep a copy of it with yourself. Because you will be using it for the next homework.

Create three arrays called Names$(10) and accountnumbers(10) and balance(10). Notice that the Names$(10) array is a string array while accountnumbers(10) and balance(10) are numeric arrays.

Write a program to display the menu with the following options and ask for the user input.

    Type P to populate accounts
    Type S to search for account.
    Type E to exit.

    If the user types P.
        Populate all the three arrays.
        And display the menu again.
    If the user types S then:
        Ask the user for the account number.
        Search the array for that account number and find its position in the accountnumbers array.
        Display the Name$, and balance at the position found during the above search.
    If the user types E. then:
        Terminate the program.
    If the user types any other option:
        Display the message “Invalid Choice. Try again” and go back and display the menu.

PS: You program must keep displaying the menu until the user types the option E, to exit the program.
